We decided to use AZ as the experience previously had been great. This time round was shocking. On moving day, the movers were a no show. We kept trying the office number and emailing with no response. We had to end up getting another company to save the day. We did receive an email trying to explain the driver had an accident and the person in the office was on annual leave. I do not believe this for a second. Even if it was true was one man going to move a four bedroom house alone? No, there would have been the other 2 movers who could have phoned me.\n\nI cannot recommend this company anymore after this experience. Please be aware if you pay using PayPal there is a charge of \u00a335 and this is not refunded to you when they do not show up!\n\n--\n\nWe used AZ movers for our recent house move and couldn't have been happier. We had a number of quotes and decided on AZ because of reviews and price.\nOn the move day we were in chaos. The developers had not confirmed key handover times or had any contact with us. The movers were patient and relaxed and really friendly . We did not feel rushed by them at all, which was really great considering everything was up in the air.\nWe will definitely use AZ movers for our next house move whenever that will be!",

On the day of our move we'd grossly underestimated how much we needed to pack and they helped us fill the final boxes. It took them most of the day to get us moved, but during that time the 2 movers didn't take any breaks, just an hour for lunch. Everything had to be carried up two flights of stairs as we've no lift and they did it with no complaints. Fast, efficient. One caveat, we went for the hourly rate instead of fixed price and we ended up paying slightly more but in the end we underestimated how much needed to be moved by about a third. If you're not sure, go for the fixed rate! And if you're not already pre-packed when ordering the move, assume you need one of the larger size vans. The woman we were dealing with advised us not to go for the smallest and we took her advice, in the end they could hardly close the door on the Luton van we ordered (which was massive).\n\nAll in all they made what's traditionally one of the most stressful parts of moving completely stress free.

    "review_text": "I have a lot of concerns about this company. I am not sure this company owns any of their own vans or if the actual owners even live in another country and just book contractors.\n\nIt all started well. Victoria was very polite and friendly, a man (Gabriel) arrived to measure up the house ready to quote us. We had quite a lot of stuff so I was very clear to show him around the whole house and show him everything that was going. He left and quoted us for 2 Luton vans. I did not think much at this point as my grandparents owned a removal company so I know that normally a removal company is responsible for quoting correctly. I then had a different company come and quote me (a real removal company... we will get to that later), the person checking told me we needed their biggest lorry, I told him I had been quoted for 2 Luton vans and he said he was not sure it would all fit on 2 Luton vans, that I should be careful, it was the companies responsibility if that was what was quoted, but it could cause issues if they couldn't fit it all in the van as they would then have to arrange something and it could delay the move.\n\nUnfortunately due to issues with our moving date, we couldn't book anyone in until the last minute. On the Tuesday, we had the go ahead that we SHOULD be moving on the following Sunday, but it would not be confirmed until Thursday. AZ Movers were the only company that had quoted me that were still available. I asked Victoria if she was able to hold the spot for me for 2 days just to get it all confirmed. She agreed. On Thursday at 16:10 I had confirmation so I emailed Victoria to confirm that booking. On Friday she came back to me to say that the vans had now gone but that she was trying to sort something out. I was a bit irritated and she mentioned about the system updating overnight and the vehicles not being available. Believing this to be an Edinburgh based company with their own vans, I didn't give this a second thought. I now believe that because Victoria is actually based in Pakistan (we will get to this later) she did not receive my email until the next morning (as it would have been much later than 4pm when she received the email). Victoria managed to get someone who was able to complete the move, but the price had increased by an extra 10% due to having to find extra vans.\nFrustrated but understanding that maybe there was a glitch that meant that someone else in her team must have booked the vans that Victoria had reserved for me, I accepted the extra charge.\n\nSo then moving day arrived. The 2 Luton vans arrived and the drivers asked if Victoria was there. There was some confusion about the drivers having not realised they were booked as a third party but I had assumed that could be the case rather than it being AZ vans due to the booking issue. The guys that arrived were really great, professional and friendly but this was their first job with AZ so not normally AZ movers, therefore I cannot say what the normal drivers are like. They did raise concerns on seeing the house that there was more stuff than they had space for. They told me that Victoria had not sent them all the pictures, and if they had seen them, they would have said at the time. So I started dismantling every single piece of furniture, just to give us every single cm of space. (even though when Gabriel had come round he had said I would not need to). The vans loaded and there was still around half a trucks worth of stuff left AND we had decided the day before to leave our large fridge. So we had been massively underquoted. When I got the details from the drivers for Victoria they gave me her number via WhatsApp. The number for Victoria came up as in Pakistan. When I called the office numb I had realised it was being forwarded to a mobile number, but I assumed due to covid that Victoria was just working from home. I had been right. Office address is a mailbox with nearly 1000 companies registered there. Wanted to charge an extra \u00a31000 to complete the move. Refused to accept removal companies charge for the move not the van hire. AVOID",

    "owner_answer": "We did in fact serve Wayne, He is an authentic customer with good and polite communication, so a customer that any company would like to have. We can't fault on his professional and polite approach; the move was from Edinburgh all the way to Ipswich.\n\nHowever, we would like to highlight a few things here, which may have caused some confusion, especially for timings & delays which was the main concern on the day.\n\nThis job was booked very last minute, on the 24th about an hour before the offices close. The calendar was clear of any moves at this point, I requested a deposit, but Mr. Wayne said he would pay this in the morning \u2013 note we book on a first come first serve basis. By the morning, my colleague updated the system and there were jobs booked and deposits paid. I immediately informed Wayne in the morning, he had already paid his deposit, so I offered a refund, or I could take measures to sort it out \u2013 he chose us to sort it out so I called up a colleague who had used Thomas before and spoke highly of him, so we arranged Thomas for Wayne\u2019s move \u2013 and Wayne was happy with this but there was a price increase and we again gave Wayne the option of a full refund but he declined and agreed to pay the additional fee. We sent Thomas (The contractor) all the information we had comprehensive images and videos and Thomas confirmed that 2 large luton vans will be plenty the same opinion AZ Movers employees had - he still took one standard luton van and one custom built large Low loader just in case, despite almost everything fitting in to the van there was a lot of random smaller pieces that were scrap like \u2013 we realized this wouldn\u2019t fit. This caused rightful stress to the customer who out of Frustration may have not realized that it is not a business\u2019s responsibility to move more than what was agreed in the contract and all readers would appreciate a contract works both ways we still went out of the way to reschedule a 3rd van and charged cost price for it ofcourse - which was a small transit van since there wasn\u2019t a lot left behind but he ended up sorting it out himself. Wayne seemed to be okay with everything and we moved on from this.\n\nIt is unfortunate that Wayne seems it relevant to point out that, I, Victoria am based in Pakistan Thrice I do find it offensive. Nevertheless, I do realize Wayne spoke out of Frustration. I am now back in Scotland should anyone else care where I work from \ud83d\ude0a you are welcome to visit me \ud83d\ude0c.\n\nMost if not All moving firms in Edinburgh specifically - have only Logistics offices if any one is interested to see our logistics office, our own vehicles and our storage space please feel free to request it and we shall be completely Transparent.\n\nWayne failed to see our efforts to book and arrange such a large removal in such short notice, even with a lot of our efforts and hard work Wayne ended up withholding paying us at the time of delivery which made both me and the \u201c Contractors \u201c very uncomfortable, I signed off and let the boys handle payment with Wayne directly to ensure my boys got paid since Wayne had made it clear he wasn\u2019t paying us a dime.\n\nWe wish Wayne the best and apologize if he feels we failed him, but we do hope that now that things have settled down Wayne sees our efforts to put him first.\n\nRegards,\n\nVictoria, Nicole, Zahra, George and all the other staff members who worked hard.",

    "review_text": "We booked AZ Movers Edinburgh taking our things from London to Peebles. Overall, this was the worst customer service and experience I have ever had. They are still trying to chase us for money that was never agreed!\n\nPre-pick up date:\nWe initially provided a window from the 8-15 October for a partial load. While we understand we could have been given any date within that window, we requested a date towards the end of the window and were assured this would be taken into account.\nAt this stage we were told the confirmation of our pick up date would be confirmed by the end of September - having chased on multiple occasions, we finally received confirmation on 6 October - a week from when we should have been notified and two days before the pick up date leaving a small window to pack our belongings.\nDue to the small window, we had little choice but to book our own van at a later date. We realise this was our choice to change it but wanted to acknowledge the lack of communication/delay in confirmation leading up to this point.\nWe received the below confirmation noting an all-inclusive cost for our own van. At this point we were not made aware of sending an updated inventory list and that should we have more items we would be charged more.\n\"As discussed you\u2019ve been rescheduled for 15th of October collection in London for \u00a3900 all-inclusive.\nPlease make the remaining payment of \u00a3500 on the day of collections\"\nAfter leaving a voicemail and calling back, we were able to speak to the team who outlined our pick up time would be between 3-4pm on the 15th.\nWe left another voicemail on the morning of the 15th to confirm time-slot, did not receive a call back, and chased to find out the van would not arrive until around 7pm.\nOur tenants were due to move in on Friday afternoon, so we had a cleaner booked for Thursday and I was booked on a train based on the 3-4pm window provided.\nDue to the scheduling issue, Victoria rescheduled to the Friday morning at 9am and estimated the belongings would be in Peebles around 6/7pm.\n\nDay of pick up\nThe staff arrived just after 9am and noted the discrepancy between the list and what I noted.\n\nAfter calls with Victoria, I was made aware that an updated inventory list should have been sent and that costs for greater than 1/2 a van would be \u00a31,200.\n\nThe staff started loading at 9:20am and were finished by 9:45am. I believe our things would have made up a maximum of 1/2 van but likely closer to 1/3 if it was packed properly. So we we didn't feel the \u00a31,200 charge even matches the job. The van already had items in it and the staff mentioned they were picking up bikes on their way. So from my understanding, they had taken our dedicated van and added extra bookings.\n\nBecause of this service, we've had to rebook cleaners multiple times and postpone our tenants arrival time on the Friday. My partner travelled up to Scotland to meet the van and instead of having a day and a half to sort, had a few hours on Friday night and left to come back to London Saturday morning.\n\nWe also found the short time window provided by Victoria, at 13:50, of paying an invoice (which was not attached to the email) by close of play before starting the process with a debt collector unacceptable and unprofessional. Even though I responded within an hour to escalate, we heard nothing back and had had to call to get answers before the set deadline.\n\nOverall this has been the worst customer experience we\u2019ve ever had. As a removal company, they know how much planning and time goes into a move. This company has made this whole process more complicated and we feel it is unacceptable to pay any additional charges. We've been completely messed around and we actually should receive a partial refund for the lack of communication, delay in our move and other incurred costs to us.",

    "review_text": "I used AZ Movers to move my one bed flat contents into storage and they offered the cheapest quote. Like Tom's review previously, I think it's fair to give an overview of the pros and cons of using this removal company:\n\nCons\n1. Two removal guys showed up on the day but forgot key to lorry door padlock, so they couldn't open the back of the lorry and had to go to a garage to get the padlock opened.\n2. About 45 mins later when the packers returned, they asked me where the boxes and packaging materials were. I was confused as I thought the packers brought them on the day of the move. They said the boxes should have been delivered in advance of the move but no boxes had been delivered to my flat.\n3. No prior communication from AZ movers to confirm the boxes would be delivered to my address. If I had been aware of this I would have made prior arrangements to be home that day to accept delivery.\n4. The packers then had to leave again to go get boxes and packaging material for the move.\n5. While the packers were away buying more boxes, the boxes that I had pre-ordered from AZ Movers showed up at a neighbour's flat. They were extremely small for the contents of a one bed flat and only a tiny amount of bubble wrap was provided. If I had known AZ Movers provided terrible boxes and packaging then I would have gone elsewhere to buy my own.\n6. Due to all the delays, the move was running late and we still had to unpack the van at the other end and move everything into storage before the storage unit closed, so I assisted the lads with some of the packing and moving contents into the van. I was happy to help to move things along but some customers may not be so understanding especially if they pay extra for a packing service.\n\nPros:\n\n1. The packers were hardworking on the day and very friendly. If it wasn't for them buying more boxes and a roll of bubble wrap when the delivery didn't show up, then we wouldn't have got the contents fitted into the original boxes provided by AZ Movers.\n\n2. The company offers a very cheap rate for moving.\n\nAll in all, it worked out ok in the end but compared to other removal companies in Edinburgh this is not what I would describe as a professional removal service. I wouldn't use them again and won't be recommending them to others. I would say this is a good example of you get what you pay for.",

Hence, we would like to assure you we will no longer be using them and have officially removal them from our vendors and now sell packing material on our website directly.\n\nSince, We were at error and all this could have been avoided should we have communicated effectively we will call you ( Miss Elle Mcmaster ) and discuss what we can do to make you feel more secure and ensure you that we are indeed professionals who take full responsibility & look out for all our customers should we cause them inconvenience. Please get in touch so we can discuss a partial refund since we feel obliged to pay back customers should they have had to assist the movers especially since we were hired to do it all.\n\nWe hope to solve any concerns and add more pros to your list. :)\n\nRegards,\nZahra P.\nDirector",

I hope the points in my review can be used by the company to make constructive improvements.\n\nTom Carter\n\nI used AZ movers as they were cheaper than the other quotes. My wife advised me against choosing the cheapest quote, but I ignored her. Here is my balanced review.\n\nNegatives:\n1. Two guys turned up to pack the night before but thought they were here to remove already packed items.\n2. No delivery of packing goods ie, boxes, tape etc. The 'packers' then had to go to the nearest warehouse and then start packing late.\n3. Packers clearly ran out of steam/ couldn't be bothered and left 30% of things in the house unpacked. Very kindly left us a note saying 'we have left some spare boxes, please feel free to continue packing your stuff into them' - despite is paying for a comprehensive packing service.\n4. Two lads the next day then managed to smash some crystal wedding gifts.\n5. Wardrobe doors deeply scratched.\n6. Staff very happy to undermine their own bosses/managers, which raises concerns about the working relationships within the company.\n\nPositives:\n1. Was cheaper than the rest\n2. The guys who did the moving part of the job were lovely and worked very hard all day without moaning, for which we are grateful for (despite the above breakages).\n\nIn summary:\nWould I use them again - no\nWould I recommend them to others - no\nAlways listen to your wife - sadly they are usually right!",

We were moving 50 miles away. At 8pm I told them to leave the rest of my stuff as I was exhausted. I have contacted the company about most of the damage and the bike being left but they replied they had received my email and then nothing.

They came to my house to quote & quoted to supply packaging, pack all my possessions, move everything then clean my house.\nThe wrong size boxes arrived, they pitched up late to pack then ran out of boxes within 2 hours, so couldn't finish the packing on the allocated day. Arrived the next day at 10am instead of 8am like their website says, carried on packing, then only managed to move half my possessions on the moving day. That night I got an email saying it would be an additional \u00a3720 if I wanted them to complete the move the next day!\nFurthermore, they damaged my leather lounge suites, damaged my walls, used my tools (& lost them) to dismantle furniture & lost my bolts for a bed. Then because they couldn't finish the move, the cleaning had to be delayed to the Wednesday. They then changed that to the Friday but I had to return keys to the agents, so I couldn't use their cleaning service. They have refused to return the whole amount quoted for the cleaning & have refunded \u00a320 for the damages to my walls while the invoice for the cleaning is \u00a3145.\nStay away from these guys, all they do is apologise for their incompetence & mistakes but don't take responsibility!",

We hope that all readers will take into consideration that we are a genuine local business with satisfied customers and this review does not reflect the service that our customer\u2019s experience.",

They don't answer emails, they don't respond to voicemails. I then tried to cancel my booking due to their unresponsiveness and Victoria (who seems to be the only person working in this company) then started to respond and became completely unprofessional. She LIED about conversations we'd had, she accused me of lying, and she even CHANGED THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WITHOUT INFORMING ME during our discussion to try and make me ineligible to get my deposit back. Since then, I have had a case opened with both TRADING STANDARDS and the SHERRIFF COURT to try and retrieve my money and they will not respond to either of them.\n\nI do not believe for a second that any of these positive reviews are genuine customers since they have completely scammed me out of \u00a3240 during the most stressful period of my life! The stress that this company have cause me has resulted in a chronic medical condition and 8 months after paying for a service, I still have nothing in return.\n\nI HONESTLY DONT KNOW HOW THESE PEOPLE SLEEP AT NIGHT!",

Our cancellation policy has never changed, it has been the same through out 2017-2021. I can assure you I am not aware of any officials ( trading standards ) that have gotten in touch. We have the right to change or terms and conditions whenever necessary however I am the only one authorized to do so and Guarantee that it isn't possible.\n\nNevertheless! If you have a genuine case I will personally refund you as a gesture of good will, feel free to draft an email and send it to me azmoversuk@gmail.com\n\nIt is common practice to charge cancellation fees, especially if cancellations are made last minute this is because we have already put resources towards the move and allocated times and have denied other customers who may want the same date as you. Our labors are still paid for the day and administration, paper work has been done this is behind the scene efforts that unfortunately aren't available for the public to see and there are charges in place to protect us, that is the reason a deposit is taken In the first place.\nWe offer free date changes as well as free postponing this is because we know that the job will still take place today or 6 months from now. However, we do not offer free cancelations nor does any other business in Edinburgh as the industry is small we all have the same rules.\n\nYour frustrations are justified, when we pay an amount we expect a service to take place but if the service hasn't taken place for reasons not concerning us there is not much we can do, this was especially true in your case. I have offered you a good deal if you're interested why not get in touch via email and if I believe you had a genuine case I will personally refund you and will be more than happy for you to share more honest views on a public forum rather than one sided views which are incorrect and not factual.",

We expressed that this delay would result in a charge to which Mr. Cuthbert felt dissatisfied. He paid \u00a335 and unfortunately judging by the review may have been the factor of his disappointment as we had provided an exceptional service and at no fault of AZ Movers did the move become disappointing we instead were very accommodating with Mr. Cuthbert's delays and changes in times through out the removal and were sincerely not expecting a review to be posted for the \u00a335 we requested to cover the boys hours who worked very hard that day.
