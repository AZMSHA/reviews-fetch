    "review_text": "Really recommend them. They were extremely efficient, communicative, and accommodating. I paid \u00a3207 for five boxes to be transported from Edinburgh to London. They were flexible with the amount of boxes and the shape, type, weight, and contents of the boxes (unlike other companies that are so picky). They delivered and dropped off on time and gave me a narrow time window, so I didn\u2019t have to wait around all day. I called several times with questions and this lovely lady always answered and was very clear and on the ball. She quickly changed my order for me at late notice. The delivery man was also very adaptive and communicative with timings. The service was really everything I wanted (my friends have had nightmare experiences with other companies like LoveSpace). So I really recommend AZ movers.",

They even left a pushbike outside my old house (not mine!) as they didn't want it. I did ask and pay for another man and van at short notice which ended up being the same guys doing 2 trips. We were moving 50 miles away. At 8pm I told them to leave the rest of my stuff as I was exhausted. I have contacted the company about most of the damage and the bike being left but they replied they had received my email and then nothing. Initially they were lovely to deal with but aftercare is appalling. I maybe depends on who you get to move your items.",
